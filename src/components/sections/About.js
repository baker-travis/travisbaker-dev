      <h2>About Me</h2>

        My name is Travis Baker, software engineer by day and lover of all
        things tech by night. I grew up town-hopping between Oklahoma and Texas
        every few years, with a 3 year stint in Dubai, UAE. After about a year
        of college, I served a 2 year mission for{' '}
        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/">
          The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
        </a>
        . I spent my college years at a combination of <a href="https://www.baylor.edu/">Baylor University</a>, <a href="https://www.byu.edu/">BYU</a>,
        and <a href="https://byui.edu/">BYU—Idaho</a>. I graduated from BYU—Idaho with a Bachelor's degree in Software
